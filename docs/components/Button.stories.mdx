# Button

This is a documentation of `<Button/>` component.
Buttons are elements of interaction with the interface allowing the user to perform an action.
They are used to show the user’s choice of options for actions and assign these to a clear hierarchy.
For example, a button helps the user to find the most important actions of a page or within a viewport and enables
them to perform these actions. The label is used to clearly indicate to the user what action will be triggered.
Buttons allow users to commit a change, complete steps in a task, or make choices.

## Structure

The button is made up of the following elements:

-   a label - mandatory.

-   a icon, can be modified - optional.

## Variations

-   [Primary button](#primary-button)
-   [Secondary button](#secondary-button)
-   [Ternary button](#tertiary-button)
-   [Disabled status](#disabled-status)
-   [Buttons with icon](#buttons-with-icon)

### Primary button

The primary button is used for main actions such as submitting a form or redirecting to content that you want to prioritize in the user journey.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Primary button">
        <div className={css({ "margin": 20 })} />
        <Button href="" variant="primary">
            {" "}
            Button text
        </Button>
    </Story>
</Canvas>

```tsx
<Button href="" variant="primary">
    Button text
</Button>
```

To be efficient and prioritize the actions offered to the user, limit the use of the primary button to 1 per screen
and never use two primary buttons side by side. You can align a primary button with a secondary or tertiary button.

### Secondary button

The secondary button is used when the action has lower priority than the primary action,
such as canceling, rewinding or resetting values ​​on a form.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Secondary button">
        {[false, true].map(dark => (
            <Fragment key={dark}>
                <div className={css({ "margin": 20 })} />
                <StoryProvider dark={dark}>
                    <Button href="" variant="secondary">
                        Button text
                    </Button>
                </StoryProvider>
            </Fragment>
        ))}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

```tsx
<Button href="" variant="secondary">
    Button text
</Button>
```

### Ternary button

The tertiary button is a third level of action, more rare,
is used for external links or resetting values ​​on a form.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Ternary button">
        {[false, true].map(dark => (
            <Fragment key={dark}>
                <div className={css({ "margin": 20 })} />
                <StoryProvider dark={dark}>
                    <Button href="" variant="tertiary">
                        Button text
                    </Button>
                </StoryProvider>
            </Fragment>
        ))}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

```tsx
<Button href="" variant="tertiary">
    Button text
</Button>
```

### Disabled status

The inactive state indicates that the user cannot interact with the button.
It should be only used very occasionally. For example, when we want to indicate
to the user that he must take an upstream action.

<Canvas>
    <Story name=" Disabled status">
        {[false, true].map(dark => (
            <Fragment key={dark}>
                <StoryProvider dark={dark}>
                    <div className={css({ "margin": 20 })} />
                    <Button href="" disabled={true}>
                        Button text
                    </Button>
                </StoryProvider>
            </Fragment>
        ))}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

```tsx
<Button href="" disabled={true}>
    Button text
</Button>
```

### Button with icon

It is possible to add an icon to your button allowing a better understanding of the action.
To do this, all you have to do is use the icon's CSS class ([See the icons documentation](...))
Two variations are possible:

-   with icon to the right
-   with icon to the left

⚠️ Single icon, to use a single icon [see the icon button documentation](...)

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Button with right icon">
        {[false, true].map(dark => (
            <Fragment key={dark}>
                <div className={css({ "margin": 20 })} />
                <StoryProvider dark={dark}>
                    <Button href="" endIcon="help">
                        Button text
                    </Button>
                </StoryProvider>
            </Fragment>
        ))}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

```tsx
<Button href="" endIcon="help">
    Button text
</Button>
```

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Button with left icon">
        {[false, true].map(dark => (
            <Fragment key={dark}>
                <div className={css({ "margin": 20 })} />
                <StoryProvider dark={dark}>
                    <Button href="" startIcon="help">
                        Button text
                    </Button>
                </StoryProvider>
            </Fragment>
        ))}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

```tsx
<Button href="" startIcon="help">
    Button text
</Button>
```

## Rules of use

-   Use a primary button for the next best action. Remaining calls-to-action should be represented as secondary or text buttons.
-   Use buttons in consistent locations in the user interface to improve user experience.
-   Only use one or two primary buttons per viewport, no limits per page.
-   Button labels must describe the action the button will perform and should include a verb. Use concise, specific, self-explanatory labels.
-   Button labels should always include a noun if there is any room for interpretation about what the verb operates on.
-   You must use the same writing format on all your button labels (Example: 1st letter in uppercase, the rest in lowercase, imperative).
-   Do not use generic labels like "Ok," especially in the case of an error; errors are never "Ok".
-   Use the button group component when there is a need to combine or lay out multiple buttons, and express different emphasis levels (e.g. one primary button and one secondary button).
-   Do not use two primary buttons in a button group.
-   Do not use a button for a text link or navigation item.
