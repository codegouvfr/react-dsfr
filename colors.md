# 🎨 Colors

Most of the time, when using the provided components from the Design System for French Republic (DSFR), there is no need to explicitly manipulate colors. These components are designed with a set of default colors that aim to maintain consistency and harmony across your application or website. However, when you are crafting a new component or customizing existing ones, it becomes essential to select the appropriate color scheme that aligns with the DSFR guidelines for your specific use case.

To assist you in effortlessly navigating through the DSFR color palette and selecting the perfect hues for your components, we provide you with a user-friendly color picker tool. This tool is designed to simplify the process of choosing colors that adhere to the DSFR’s design principles, ensuring that your custom components not only look visually appealing but also maintain a cohesive and unified design language.
